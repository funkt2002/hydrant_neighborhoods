# hydrant_neighborhoods
This project aims to determine neighborhoods of hydrants along a road network as well as consequent shortest paths using multiple different algorithms

All included scripts read shapefiles of Santa Barbara Road and hydrant data, and uses shapely and NetworkX to perform network analysis; creating different algorithms for identifying neighboring hydrants to a given source hydrant as well as shortest paths to them.
